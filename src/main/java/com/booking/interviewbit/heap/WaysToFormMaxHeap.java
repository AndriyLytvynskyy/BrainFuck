/**
 * Max Heap is a special kind of complete binary tree in which for every node the value present in that node is greater than the value present in itâ€™s children nodes. If you want to know more about Heaps, please visit this link

 So now the problem statement for this question is:
 How many distinct Max Heap can be made from n distinct integers

 In short, you have to ensure the following properties for the max heap :

 Heap has to be a complete binary tree ( A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. )

 Every node is greater than all its children

 Let us take an example of 4 distinct integers. Without loss of generality let us take 1 2 3 4 as our 4 distinct integers

 Following are the possible max heaps from these 4 numbers :
